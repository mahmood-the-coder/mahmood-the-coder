# Page Layout with Adjustable Containers

This document describes a flexible page layout containing a **header**, **footer**, **main container**, and **side containers**. The size of these containers can be adjusted using ruler handles.

## Structure of the Page

The page consists of the following sections:

1. **Header** - The top section of the page.
2. **Footer** - The bottom section of the page.
3. **Main Container** - The central content area.
4. **Left Container** - A sidebar positioned on the left.
5. **Right Container** - A sidebar positioned on the right.

## Adjustable Layout with Ruler Handles

The layout includes **four ruler handles** that allow resizing of the containers:

- **Top Ruler Handle**: Adjusts the height of the header.
- **Bottom Ruler Handle**: Adjusts the height of the footer.
- **Left Ruler Handle**: Adjusts the width of the left container.
- **Right Ruler Handle**: Adjusts the width of the right container.

### Behavior of Ruler Handles

- Dragging the **top ruler handle** resizes the **header** and adjusts the main content height accordingly.
- Dragging the **bottom ruler handle** resizes the **footer** and modifies the main container height.
- Moving the **left ruler handle** changes the width of the **left container**, affecting the main container width.
- Moving the **right ruler handle** changes the width of the **right container**, also impacting the main container.

## Cursor Interaction

The **insert cursor** allows users to click and insert content inside the main container. This provides an interactive way to edit and format the page.

This layout provides a **dynamic** and **customizable** page structure, allowing users to adjust the workspace to their needs.
