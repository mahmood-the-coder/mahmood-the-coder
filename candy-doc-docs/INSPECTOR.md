# Inspector Tools Overview

In the Inspector, located on the left, you can customize the selected blocks. Below, we discuss the general tools available in the Inspector:

## 1. Transform

The **Transform** tool allows you to position, rotate, scale, or skew the selected block.

- **Rotation**: To rotate the block, first determine the axis of rotation by setting values for the X, Y, and Z axes between -1 and 1. Then, adjust the amount to rotate it around the axis.
- The rest of the **Transform** tool features are self-explanatory, enabling you to modify the blockâ€™s position and size.

## 2. Align

The **Align** tool allows you to align the block horizontally within its container.

## 3. Border

The **Border** tool lets you apply a border to the top, bottom, right, or left of your block. 

- You can customize the border's **color** and **width** using the **Border Color** and **Border Width** tools.

## 4. Radius

With the **Radius** tool, you can round or sharpen the corners of the block.

## 5. Background

The **Background** tool allows you to set multiple backgrounds, including color gradients, for your block.

- **Background Size**: You can adjust the size of each individual background.
- **Background Repeat**: You can choose whether the background should repeat or not.

## 6. Border Image

The **Border Image** tool enables you to set an image for the border of your block. 

- The image is recommended to be **horizontally and vertically symmetrical**.
- You can slice the image and tweak other options to ensure the border image looks nice around the block.
