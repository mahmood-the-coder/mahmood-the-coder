# Welcome to candy doc
Candy Doc is an advanced word processor that allows you to create and organize content using a flexible block-based system. You can add text boxes, images, charts, tables, and more, arranging them into pages and chapters with a structured hierarchy. Each block is fully customizable through the built-in inspector.

One of Candy Doc’s powerful features is dynamic text, which automatically updates based on the position of pages and chapters in the hierarchy. Creating a table of contents is as simple as a single click.

Need to duplicate a block with slight variations, such as different page numbers or chapter names? Candy Doc has you covered! Using dynamic text and page actions, you can achieve this effortlessly—again, with just one click.
