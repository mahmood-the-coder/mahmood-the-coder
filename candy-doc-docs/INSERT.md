# Inserting Blocks into a Container

To insert a block, position the cursor where you want the block to appear. You can move the cursor by **right-clicking** or **dragging** it within a container.

## Moving the Cursor Between Containers
If you want to place the cursor in a different container, you must **right-click** on the target container. Dragging the cursor alone won't move it across containers.

## Container Layout
Each page consists of **five containers**:

1. **Main container** – Center of the page
2. **Left container**
3. **Right container**
4. **Header container** – Top of the page
5. **Footer container** – Bottom of the page

You can insert blocks into any of these containers.

## Inserting Blocks
Above the cursor, you'll find the **Insert Toolbar**, which includes the following block options:

- **Text box**
- **Ordered list**
- **Unordered list**
- **Chart**
- **Table**
- **Shapes**
- **Image**
- **Diagram**

To insert a block, simply click on its corresponding icon in the toolbar.

## Moving Blocks
Once a block is inserted into a container, it remains there. To move it to a different container, you must **cut** and **paste** it into the new container. Dragging alone will not transfer it between containers.
