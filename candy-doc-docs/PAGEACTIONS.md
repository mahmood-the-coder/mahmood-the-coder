# Page Action Documentation

The **Page Action** feature in your application provides a convenient way to apply blocks (such as headers, footers, page numbers, or chapter titles) across multiple pages or chapters. This document explains how to use the **Apply to All Pages** and **Apply to Chapter** buttons located at the bottom-left of the application.

## **How to Use Page Actions**
1. **Select a Block**:
   - Click on the block you want to apply (e.g., a footer with page numbers, a header with a chapter title, or any other reusable content).
   
2. **Choose an Action**:
   - Click **Apply to All Pages** to apply the block to every page in the document.
   - Click **Apply to Chapter** to apply the block to all pages within the current chapter.

3. **Confirmation**:

## **Use Cases**
- **Page Numbers**: Add page numbers to the footer and apply them to all pages or a specific chapter.

This feature is particularly useful for creating professional documents with standardized layouts.
