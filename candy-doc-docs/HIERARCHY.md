# Document Hierarchy and Table of Contents

## Hierarchy Overview
On the right, you can see the document hierarchy. This section allows you to:

- Add new pages
- Create chapters
- Organize pages within chapters
- Rename your document

## Dynamic Table of Contents
The hierarchy automatically generates a dynamic table of contents. Any changes made to the hierarchy will be reflected in the table of contents accordingly.
